Installation:

(Short version is copypasting mod /Data folder and its content to game /Data folder.)


1. Extract and open downloaded mod folder, you will see a /Data folder.

2. Now find where Overgrowth is installed. Inside install folder is a /Data folder
(on Windows most likely: C:\Program Files (x86)\Wolfire\Overgrowth\Data)

3. Merge mod /Data folder with Overgrowth/Data folder. That is: copypaste all content from mod /Data into game /Data.
Recommended to create backup of duplicate files(aircontrols.as, aschar.as) before merging.

4.Have fun

To uninstall mod overwrite modded script files (aircontrols.as, aschar.as) with backup original files. You can also find these original script files on forum.
If you have other mods installed affecting aircontrols.as oraschar.as you might have to unintsall those mods before installing this mod.




Controls:
f key toggles flight on or off.

Hold left mouse button (lmb) to flap wings and gain height. When doing this you control direction with wasd movement keys.

Hold rmb to glide. In this mode you will fly where you look.

Shift activates air dash. When dashing you will go very fast and can bounce off the ground. With high enough speed it can even be used to kill enemies. You get 1 dash per flight but can reactivate it by wall jumping or killing enemies.

While gliding you can grab enemies. Make sure to have enough speed and swoop in on them holding rmb (Speed requirement disabled in video below). Hold space and rmb if you want to glide without grabbing nearby enemies.
