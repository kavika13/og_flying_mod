## Installation:

_Short version is copypasting `/FlyingMod` folder and its content into game `/Mods` folder._

1. Extract and open downloaded mod folder, you will see a `/FlyingMod` folder.

2. Now find where Overgrowth is installed. Inside install folder is a `/Data/Mods` folder
   (on Windows most likely: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Wolfire\Overgrowth\Data\Mods`)

3. Copy the mod /FlyingMod folder into the game /Data/Mod folder.

4. Have fun

If you have other mods installed that contain `aircontrols.as` or `aschar.as`,
then you might have to uninstall those mods before installing this mod.

## Controls:

- <kbd>f</kbd> key toggles flight on or off.

- Hold left mouse button (`lmb`) to flap wings and gain height.
  When doing this you control direction with wasd movement keys.

- Hold `rmb` to glide. In this mode you will fly where you look.

- <kbd>Shift</kbd> activates air dash. When dashing you will go very fast and can bounce off the ground.
  With high enough speed it can even be used to kill enemies.
  You get one dash per flight but can reactivate it by wall jumping or killing enemies.

- While gliding you can grab enemies.
  Make sure to have enough speed and swoop in on them holding `rmb`.
  Hold <kbd>space</kbd> and `rmb` if you want to glide without grabbing nearby enemies.
